# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

:80 {
    log {
		# Redact the authorization query parameter that can be set by Mercure
		format filter {
			request>uri query {
				replace authorization REDACTED
			}
		}
	}

    # Set this path to your site's directory.
    root * /usr/share/caddy

    # Enable the static file server.
    file_server

    # Redirect all missmatched paths to index.html -> this is the way how PWA works
